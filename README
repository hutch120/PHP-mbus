PHP port of the MBUS protocol.

A project required we integrate to a MBUS device. There is a free C version of the MBUS protocol available, but working with C memory
management and C string manipulation is so ridiculous so I built a PHP version of the MBUS protocol.

This is a work in progress and at this stage has only has only a partial implementation of the protocol for the particular
device we are required to integrate to our service.

If anyone would like to be a contributor please contact the author via the github contact page.

This project is over 11 years old. I haven't worked on MBUS in many many years. Perhaps this project might be useful for others, setting to read-only archive mode.
